# 1.Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 
#   but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The 
#   numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a 
#   single line.
l=[]
for i in range(2000, 3201):
    if (i%7==0) and (i%5!=0):
        l.append(str(i))
        print ','join(l)

# 4. Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.
#    Formula: V=4/3 * Ï€ * r

import math;
pi = math.pi;
#Converting Diameter into radius
r = float(12/2);
V = (float(4/3)*(pi)*(r)**3);
